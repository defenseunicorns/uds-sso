                Authservice retrieves JWT identifiers from the IdP which include various "claims" including the username of individuals, and a

                By restricting the lifetime of the JWT, Authservice will reauthenticate the user when it expires. The IdP can then implement concurrent 
                session control, enforced during re-authentication. This control can then be inherited from the IdP.
